### Light

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269226485951234068/714333640993144872/light.png)

This block emulates a ceiling light found in many places around the school.

### Phantom Light

Phantom lights are invisible light sources. They are used when the normal lights aren't bright enough to illuminate an entire room. Because they are retextured [End Rods](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/End_Rod), players can still collide with them so they should be placed away from locations where players would normally be.

### Chairs

These are the chairs that are commonly found in classrooms, the cafeteria etc.

![Beach Chair](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269226485951234068/594946757964726451/Beach_Chair.png)

### Whiteboard

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269226485951234068/594970426447364210/Whiteboard.png)

A whiteboard is made up of different opened trapdoors. The trapdoors are Whiteboard Corner 1, Whiteboard Corner 2, Whiteboard Horizontal, Whiteboard Vertical, Whiteboard. The placement of the trapdoors matter. The above image can be produced if the trapdoors are placed like so in the following image. Note that some trapdoors are placed at the top of the block, while some are placed at the bottom.

### Corkboard

A corkboard is a re-textured painting (`alban`); as a result it actually extrudes from the wall. If an [invisible sign](#invisible-sign) is placed before the painting is placed, then you can have text show up on the corkboard as seen in the following image:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269226485951234068/714338083880828928/corkboard.png)

> An easier way of placing these corkboards is currently being investigated

### Toilets

This sign is used to show the names of different hallways. You should dye the text white to make the text visible.

### Recycling Bin

A recycling bin is a container used to hold recyclables before they are taken to recycling centers. Recycling bins exist in various sizes for use inside and outside homes, offices, and large public facilities.

### Green Bin

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269226485951234068/594947148345376806/Organic_Waste.png" width="256">

A green bin is a short, rigid container used to contain biodegradable waste or compostable materials as a means to divert waste from landfills. In some localities green bins are also used to contain unsorted municipal waste. The bins are designed and manufactured by Norseman Environmental (an ORBIS brand), a manufacturer of recycling and organic waste containers in North America.

### Vending Machine

![Vending Machine](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269226485951234068/594944742584877064/Vending_Machine.png)

A Vending Machine is made up of 2 blocks. Place the "Vending Machine Top" block in the top-left corner and the "Vending Machine Bottom" block in the bottom-left corner. Since there are no blocks in the right side of the vending machine, you should place barrier blocks so players won't be able to walk through the vending machine.

### Vents

> Might be subject to change

_Vents on a brick wall_

They can be placed on walls to look like vents. Because they are retextured [Ladders](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ladder), players can climb on these vents.

### TV
